# EVSE Load Balancer for Home Assistant

**EVSE Load Balancer** is an integration for [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) that provides a universal load balancing solution for electric vehicle (EV) chargers. It eliminates the need for additional vendor-specific hardware (and endless P1-port device clutter) by leveraging existing energy meters and sensors in your Home Assistant setup.

## Features

- **Dynamic Load Balancing**: Automatically adjusts the charging current of your EV charger based on the available power in your home.
- **Broad Meter Support**: Works with DSMR-compatible meters or allows manual configuration based on existing entities for advanced setups.
- **Flexible Charger Integration**: Compatible with a range of EV chargers, such as Easee.

### Roadmap

- **Force PV Usage**: Introduce an option to prioritize the use of produced power (e.g., solar PV) for charging the EV, minimizing grid dependency.
- **Dynamic Tariff-Based Charging**: Enable the creation of charge plans that optimize charging times based on dynamic electricity tariffs, ensuring charging occurs at the lowest possible cost.

## How It Works

During setup of the EVSE Load Balancer integration it expects to be provided with a meter source, charger device and main fuse parameters. It will then monitor the power consumption and production in your home and dynamically adjusts the charging current of your EV charger to ensure that your home's power usage stays within safe limits.

## Supported Devices

### Energy Meters
- DSMR-compatible meters (via [DSMR Smart Meter](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/dsmr/))
- Custom configurations using existing Home Assistant sensors (1-3 Phase support)

### EV Chargers
- Easee Chargers (via [nordicopen/easee_hass](https://github.com/nordicopen/easee_hass))
- ... additional chargers to be added ...

## Installation

### HACS installation
[![Open your Home Assistant instance and open a repository inside the Home Assistant Community Store.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=dirkgroenen&repository=hass-evse-load-balancer)

1. Search for "EVSE Load Balancer" in **HACS > Integrations**
2. Download the integration and restart Home Assistant.
3. Add the integration via **Settings > Devices & Services > Add Integration** and search for "EVSE Load Balancer."

### Manual
1. Copy the `custom_components/evse_load_balancer` folder to your Home Assistant `custom_components` directory.
2. Restart Home Assistant.
3. Add the integration via **Settings > Devices & Services > Add Integration** and search for "EVSE Load Balancer."

## Configuration

During setup, you will be prompted to:
- Select your EV charger.
- Select your energy meter or provide custom sensors.
- Specify the fuse size and number of phases in your home.

### Advanced Configuration
For homes without a compatible energy meter, you can manually configure sensors for each phase, including:
- Power consumption
- Power production
- Voltage

## Events and Logging

The integration emits events to Home Assistant's event log whenever the charger current limit is adjusted. These events can be used to create automations or monitor the system's behavior.

## Example Use Cases

- **Prevent Overloads**: Automatically reduce the EV charger's current when other appliances are consuming high amounts of power.
- **Optimize Solar Usage**: Increase the EV charger's current when excess solar power is available.
- **Multi-Charger Support**: Balance loads across multiple chargers in a single installation.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you encounter any issues or have ideas for improvements, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/dirkgroenen/hass-evse-load-balancer).

### Adding Charger or Meter support 
You can support EVSE Load Balancer by adding and testing additional chargers or meters. A brief overview of the steps required to follow:

1. **Create a New Charger Class**:
   - Create a new file in the `chargers` directory (e.g., `my_charger.py`).
   - Implement the `Charger` abstract base class from [`charger.py`](custom_components/evse_load_balancer/chargers/charger.py).

2. **Example**:
   Refer to the [`EaseeCharger`](custom_components/evse_load_balancer/chargers/easee_charger.py) implementation for an example of how to integrate a charger.

3. **Register the Charger**:
   - Update the `charger_factory` function in [`chargers/__init__.py`](custom_components/evse_load_balancer/chargers/__init__.py) to include your new charger class.
   - Add logic to detect the new charger based on its manufacturer or other identifiers.

#### Adding a New Meter

1. **Create a New Meter Class**:
   - Create a new file in the `meters` directory (e.g., `my_meter.py`).
   - Implement the `Meter` abstract base class from [`meter.py`](custom_components/evse_load_balancer/meters/meter.py).

2. **Example**:
   Refer to the [`DsmrMeter`](custom_components/evse_load_balancer/meters/dsmr_meter.py) implementation for an example of how to integrate a meter.

3. **Register the Meter**:
   - Update the `meter_factory` function in [`meters/__init__.py`](custom_components/evse_load_balancer/meters/__init__.py) to include your new meter class.
   - Add logic to detect the new meter based on its manufacturer or other identifiers.
