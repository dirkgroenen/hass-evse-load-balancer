          prompt: |
            Read the issue and determine if it's requesting a new Charger or Meter integration.
                                                                                                                                            
            If YES:
            1. Extract these details from the issue:
              - Type: Charger or Meter
              - Device/brand name (e.g., "Easee", "Zaptec", "HomeWizard")
              - Home Assistant integration URL and Github Source
            2. If any critical details are missing, ask the issue author for clarification via a comment
            3. Run the /create-integration skill with the extracted details
            4. After the skill completes, commit all changes with message: "Add {name} {type} integration"
            5. Create a PR with title: "Add {name} {type} integration"
            6. Request @dirkgroenen as reviewer 

            If NO (not a charger/meter request):
            - Exit without making changes
